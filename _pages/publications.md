**The Frog Model on Trees with Drift**,  Authors: Erin Beckman, Natalie Frank, Yufeng Jiang, Matthew Junge, Si Tang. <i>Electronic Communications in Probability</i>, 2019. [pdf](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/electronic-communications-in-probability/volume-24/issue-none/The-frog-model-on-trees-with-drift/10.1214/19-ECP235.full)&#13;&#10;
Consider the one-per-cite frog model on a $d$-ary tree with drift towards the root. We show that for any $d$, the frog model is recurrent with drift larger than or equal to $0.4155$.

**On the Rademacher Complexity of Linear Hypothesis Sets**, Authors: Pranjal Awasthi, Natalie Frank, Mehryar Mohri. 2020.&#13;&#10;
We give upper and lower bounds on the empirical Rademacher complexity of the linear hypothesis classes with weight factors bounded in $\ell_p$ norm. We show that our bounds improve upon existing bounds, which were known only for $1\leq p \geq 2$.
