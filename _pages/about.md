I'm a Pearson fellow and IFDS Fellow at the University of Washington. I am broadly interested in the mathematics of data science. Currently, I am researching adversarial robustness, with a focus on connections to optimal transport. Previously, I was a PhD student at Courant Institute working with Jonathan Niles-Weed.
