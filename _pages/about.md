I'm a PhD student at Courant Institute working with Jonathan Niles-Weed. I am broadly interested in the mathematics of data science. Currently, I am researching adversarial robustness, with a focus on connections to optimal transport. Starting Fall 2024, I will be a Pearson fellow and  IFDS Fellow at the University of Washington.
